// `defineWorkbench`: the whole of a host's configuration, as data.
//
// The shell takes props, which is the wrong shape for a config file: a host
// that wanted a locale switch would have to hold state, build a lens, build a
// provider, and keep the two ends agreeing. This takes the facts and returns
// the COMPONENT instead: everything with a lifecycle - the state behind a
// provider, the lens that changes it, the router adapter that must not be
// rebuilt per render - happens once, in here, so the host writes no hooks.

// A CONTROLLED provider the workbench is wrapped in, and the values it can take. This exists
// because of a specific, recurring shape: an app context that every story needs in order to
// render at all (KROMA's i18n provider - its translated components call `useT()`, which throws
// outside one), whose value is also worth flipping while looking at a design (the same
// components in French, where the words are longer and layouts break first). Declaring it here
// gets both for one price: the workbench holds the state, wraps the tree in your provider, AND
// puts a toolbar lens on it. The host writes no hooks.
