/** Grants: the only thing a KROMA server is ever given about a device.
 *
 * The problem this solves is specific to how KROMA is deployed. The app is
 * published by one team, so the Apple and Google credentials belong to that
 * team; the SERVER is self-hosted by anybody, and its source is public. There
 * is therefore no secret that can live on a server — anything shipped there is
 * readable by everyone, and a shared relay password would be world-readable the
 * day it was committed.
 *
 * So a server is not authenticated at all. Instead it is handed a CAPABILITY:
 * an opaque blob, minted by the relay, that names exactly one device and can do
 * exactly one thing — push to that device. It is issued to the app (which holds
 * the real device token), and the app passes it to whichever server the reader
 * signed into.
 *
 * What that buys, stated as the attack it prevents: to notify everyone you would
 * need everyone's grant. Grants cannot be forged without `GRANT_SECRET`, which
 * never leaves the relay, and they cannot be harvested in bulk because they are
 * only ever minted to a device that already holds its own push token. Breaking
 * into one self-hosted server yields grants for that server's own users — people
 * who already trusted it with their notifications and whom it could already
 * reach. The blast radius is the same as before the relay existed.
 *
 * The blob is SEALED, not merely signed: AES-256-GCM, so a grant is unreadable
 * as well as unforgeable. A server never learns the raw APNs/FCM token even
 * though it stores the grant, which means a leaked server database is not a
 * pile of device tokens.

 * refresh one it holds — a short life would mean push silently dying for anyone
 * who had not opened the app recently. The app refreshes on launch, so in
 * practice a grant is replaced long before this. Expiry still matters: it bounds
 * how long a grant recovered from an old backup stays useful.
