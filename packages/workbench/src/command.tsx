// The command palette: ⌘K, and the workbench's one search.
//
// The sidebar used to carry a filter field, which meant the only way to reach a
// component was to first find its section in the tree. A palette inverts that:
// type three letters from anywhere and the thing you want is one Enter away,
// which is how everyone already navigates their editor. So the tree went back to
// being navigation and this became the search.
//
// The design is cmdk's - shadcn's command dialog - because that is the shape this
// interaction has settled on everywhere it appears: an input with a hairline
// under it, results grouped under quiet headings, a cursor that is a fill rather
// than a ring, and a footer that says which keys do what. It is rebuilt out of
// <Box> and <Txt> rather than imported, for the reason nothing here is imported:
// cmdk is a DOM library, and this palette has to open on an Apple TV too.
//
// The two platforms drive it differently, and neither is emulated:
//
//   web    - one capture-phase listener on the document owns Up, Down, Enter and
//            Escape, and the cursor it moves is state in here. Capture, not
//            bubble, because react-native-web's TextInput calls stopPropagation
//            on every keydown (its issue #612): a bubble listener goes deaf the
//            moment the caret lands in the search field, which is always.
//   native - no document, so no listener. Every result is a <Focusable>, and the
//            spatial navigator moves between them exactly as it does in the tree.
//
// Which is why the cursor fill is web-only: on a television the navigator's own
// focus wash is already saying the same thing, and two highlights on one row read
// as a bug.
