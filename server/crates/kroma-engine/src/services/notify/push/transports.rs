//! The per-transport half of a push.
//!
//! Each service answers only the two questions the shared delivery loop cannot:
//! how to turn this notification into a request for THIS device, and which HTTP
//! failures mean the device is permanently gone. The loop in the parent module
//! owns everything else, so adding a transport never duplicates the health
//! bookkeeping that decides when a device is evicted.
//!
//! "Gone" is deliberately per-transport and deliberately narrow. Each service
//! has its own vocabulary for it (410, `BadDeviceToken`, `UNREGISTERED`), and
//! each also has 400s that mean *we* sent something wrong — treating those as
//! the device's fault would quietly evict every registered device the first time
//! a payload or a topic was mis-set.
