// <Grid>: the fixed-column tile grid of the browse screens.
//
// React Native has no CSS grid (and neither does the legacy webOS tier this app
// still ships to), so the columns are computed and the children laid out with
// flex wrap. Each cell gets an explicit width, which is also what lets a
// <PosterCard> simply fill its cell.
//
// The grid also DECLARES its rows to the spatial navigator. Wrapping is a
// visual arrangement, not a navigational one: without the declaration the whole
// grid is one long line and Down from the first tile walks to the second rather
// than to the tile underneath it.
