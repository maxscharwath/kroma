// <StatsChart>: one live chart of the stats panel, with every series that shares
// its axis.
//
// On the renderer, which is the question this component exists to answer
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
// It draws SVG, and it stays SVG on purpose. The obvious suspicion is that the
// geometry is the cost, so it was measured: building the point geometry for three
// 80-sample series takes ~44 us, and at the panel's 2 Hz poll that is 0.09 ms per
// SECOND of wall clock. There is nothing there to win. A canvas backend would
// need a web/native pair of this file (React Native has no canvas), and Skia
// would need a native module, which would cost Tizen and webOS their renderer
// altogether - both to reclaim microseconds.
//
// What actually costs, in order: React reconciling the panel on every poll, and
// the number of SVG nodes the compositor re-rasterises. So the effort goes there
// instead - each trace is ONE <Path> rather than the polyline pair it used to be,
// and StatsPanel keeps its slow-moving text rows out of the poll's render path.
// The geometry itself is rebuilt every render, uncached, because the measurement
// above says caching it would buy nothing and cost a staleness bug.
//
// On the design
// -------------
// Every series in one chart shares one y-axis, which is why grouping is a caller
// decision and only legal for series that share a unit (see PlayerMeter.chart).
// The marks follow the house chart specs: 2px traces with round joins, a ~10%
// area wash, an 8px end dot ringed in the surface colour so "now" is findable
// where traces cross, and a recessive hairline for a reference level. Identity is
// never colour alone - each series is direct-labelled with its own value beside a
// colour key, so the chart still reads in greyscale.
