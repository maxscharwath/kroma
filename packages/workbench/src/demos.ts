// How a demo file becomes a demo.
//
// A demo is ONE FILE, `<story>.<demo>.demo.tsx`, sitting beside the component:
//
//   components/atoms/button.detail-actions.demo.tsx
//
// Everything the workbench shows about it comes out of that file. The file name
// says which story it belongs to and what the tab is called, the doc comment
// above the default export is the prose, and the FILE ITSELF is the code sample.
//
// That last part is the point of this module. Demos used to carry a hand-written
// copy of their own source in a template literal, and every one of them had
// already drifted from the component beside it: a `signedIn` branch that only
// existed in the real example, a `validate` that only existed in the string. The
// sample cannot drift from the demo when it IS the demo.
//
// Reading a file as text is a bundler primitive, and only one of the two
// bundlers has it: Vite (`?raw`), which covers every web target - the kit site,
// the TV browser shells, the desktop app and the test runner. Metro has no
// equivalent, so on Apple TV and Android TV a demo renders with no code panel
// rather than with a stale one. The name and the prose still work there, because
// those come from the file name and are parsed from a comment when a source is
// available.
