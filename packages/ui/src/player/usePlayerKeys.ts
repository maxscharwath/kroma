// Native key source: the Apple TV / Android TV remote.
//
// The player is the one screen that does NOT use the OS focus engine. Its chrome
// is virtually focused (see usePlayerNav: a zone plus an index, with each control
// drawn from a `focused` prop) because the transport has to stay reachable while
// the chrome is fading, the progress bar scrubs by held direction, and a panel
// slides in over the top. So directional presses cannot come from focus moves the
// way they do everywhere else in the app - they have to be read off the remote.
//
// `window.addEventListener` is what the web does, and React Native defines
// `window` as `global`: the call is not missing, it is UNDEFINED, so the player
// used to take the whole app down with "undefined is not a function" the moment
// it mounted. This is the same contract fed from `useTVEventHandler`.
