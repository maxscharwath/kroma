The kit is authored against React Native and renders natively on Apple TV, Android
TV, iPhone and Android, and through react-native-web on Tizen, webOS, the Tauri
desktop shell and the web client.

That is the whole point. The components and the tokens exist once. A rail tile
looks the same on a Samsung panel and on an Apple TV because it *is* the same tile.

Every component is a FOLDER holding its code, its story, its demos and its tests.
See src/components/README.md for the hierarchy and the three ways to import from it.
```

```tsx
import { Box, Button, MediaCard, PosterCard, Text } from '@kroma/ui/kit';

<Box row center gap={16} px={64}>
  <Button variant="primary" size="tv" icon="player-play-filled" label="Lecture" />
  <MediaCard title="Blade Runner 2049" overline="Science-fiction" art={url} tint={tint} />
</Box>
```

`react` and `react-native` are peer dependencies. Components are consumed as source
through the workspace: no build step.

---

## Conventions

The component conventions follow [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).

**One component per file, named after it in kebab-case.** `button.tsx` exports
`Button`; `media-card.tsx` exports `MediaCard`. If you are looking for a component,
its filename is its name. Helpers only one component uses live in that file;
helpers that are genuinely shared (pure maths, tokens, the focus engine) live in
`lib/`.

**Four levels under `components/`**: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, each
knowing only the ones below it.
[`src/components/README.md`](src/components/README.md) owns that hierarchy: what
earns a place at each level, and how a component is shaped once it has one. It is
the document to read before adding anything.

The test for moving up a level is whether this arrangement has now been written
twice. `ListRow` earned its place after the third copy.

Every level is re-exported flat, so a consumer writes
`import { Button, ListRow } from '@kroma/ui/kit'` and never has to care which level
something is at. The split is for the people editing the kit, not for the people
using it.

**The design is declared once, at the top of the file, with `sv`.** The whole
styling engine, meaning the vocabulary, recipes, interaction states and themes, has
its own section below.

**Props carry their documentation**, the kit's one exception to the repo's
no-comment default, because a component's props are the whole of its public API. A
prop takes ONE line when its contract is not visible from its name and its type: a
default, a unit, a fallback chain, how it interacts with another prop. `focusScale`
does not say "the focus scale"; it says which controls the design scales, and by how
much. A prop whose name already says it takes nothing. The rule and its limits live
in [`CODE_STYLE.md`](../../CODE_STYLE.md).

**`ref` is a plain prop.** React 19 forwards it without `forwardRef`, so components
take it directly where a host node is useful.

---

## Styling

React Native has no `className`, so the kit has its own engine (`src/core`), built
the way Tailwind 4 builds utilities: one vocabulary, defined as data, resolved
against a theme. Everything below speaks it: `<Box>` props, recipe layers,
`styles()` declarations.

### The vocabulary

```tsx
<Box row center gap={12} px={64} py={24} bg="surface1" radius="lg" flex>
```

Layout shorthands (`row`, `center`, `gap`, `p/px/pt…`, `w/h`, `absolute`, `fill`,
`z`…) expand to React Native longhands. Colour takes a token name, a `/NN` alpha
suffix (`'accent/45'`, `'white/12'`), or any raw CSS colour. `radius` and `shadow`
take token names, and `ring: 'focusLift'` is the focus treatment, derived from the
theme's accent. Declarations, though not `<Box>`, which is a View, also take
`text: 'label'` (a whole type role, spread under the layer so longhands beside it
win) and `font: 'ui' | 'display'`.

`<Text>` speaks the half of that vocabulary a React Native `Text` honours (the
spacing, sizing and position rows, plus `textAlign`), so a string is laid out
without a style object either:

```tsx
<Text variant="leadTv" textAlign="center" maxW={640} mt={24} color="textDim">
```

It does NOT take the container rows (`row`, `gap`, `align`) or the surface paints
(`bg`, `radius`, `border`). A Text lays itself out, a Box lays out children.
`textAlign` is spelled in full because `align` already means `alignItems` on
`<Box>`, and one name means one role across the kit.

**Type is set by a role, never at a call site.** There is no `size`/`weight` prop
and `style={{ fontSize }}` is drift. If no role fits, the ramp is missing one. The
ramp has a base tier and a 10-foot tier authored for three metres rather than scaled
up from the phone's. Each is a named ladder in order: `BASE_RAMP` runs 66 down to
11, `TV_RAMP` 96 down to 13.

| Tier | Face | Roles, largest first |
| --- | --- | --- |
| base | `display` | `hero` 66 · `h1` 38 · `heading` 30 · `subheading` 26 · `h2` 22 · `title` 20 |
| base | `ui` | `body` 16 · `label` 15 · `meta` 13 · `overline` 11 |
| 10-foot | `display` | `codeTv` 96 · `heroTv` 82 · `bannerTv` 59 · `titleTv` 44 · `headingTv` 32 · `subheadingTv` 28 |
| 10-foot | `ui` | `bodyTv` 20 · `leadTv`/`labelTv`/`strongTv` 17 · `captionTv`/`metaTv`/`sectionTv` 15 · `footnoteTv`/`overlineTv` 13 |

A step is a size AND its leading (and its tracking where the design has one), which
is why a role carries a `ratio` rather than a second number to keep in step. Where
one size holds several roles, they differ in weight and leading: `labelTv` is the
600 at 17, `strongTv` the 700. A one-off weight bump at a call site is legal; a
one-off `fontSize` is not.

Sizes are plain numbers, deliberately. Every TV screen is authored against the fixed
1920x1080 canvas (see below), so a number IS the design's px value and there is no
scale to memorise. Only what genuinely IS a token (colour, radius, elevation, type)
takes a name.

The whole vocabulary is one rule table in `core/shorthands.ts`. Adding a shorthand
is adding a row, and the `satisfies` link to `BoxStyleProps` makes forgetting one a
compile error.

### Responsive values

Every value in the vocabulary can be stated per breakpoint instead of flat, so a
screen that changes shape needs neither a raw `style` object nor a
`useWindowDimensions()` branch at the call site:

```tsx
<Box px={{ base: 16, md: 40, lg: 64 }} row={{ base: false, md: true }} gap={{ base: 12, md: 24 }} />

sv({ base: { p: { base: 12, lg: 24 } } })
```

| Step | From | What it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base` | 0 | a phone, and anything narrower than the next step |
| `md` | 600 | a tablet in portrait, or a half-screen split view on one |
| `lg` | 1024 | a desktop window, or a tablet in landscape |
| `tv` | 1920 | the 10-foot stage, which IS `CANVAS.width`, and the widest desktop |

Four steps, named once in `core/tokens/layout.ts` and closed on purpose. An
augmentable set would make `{ base: 16, xl: 40 }` legal instead of a compile error.

**Mobile-first.** `base` is mandatory and means "no minimum". A step holds until the
next one the value itself names, and a missing middle step inherits from below,
never from above: `{ base: 12, tv: 48 }` is still 12 at `md` and at `lg`.

**The values are still values.** `bg={{ base: 'surface1', lg: 'surface2' }}` resolves
tokens exactly as the flat form does, through the same rule table, so nothing is
written raw to get it responsive.

**Where the width comes from.** React Native has no media query, so the active
breakpoint is a store fed by `Dimensions` at the app level, and it is NOT always the
window's. `<TvStage>` scales a fixed 1920x1080 canvas to fit the panel, so on a
television the design's width is the canvas (Android TV reports 960x540 dp for the
same screen Tizen reports as 1920x1080). `Platform.isTV` pins that for the native TV
shells; any other surface painting on a fixed stage states it once with
`pinDesignWidth(CANVAS.width)`.

**Who re-renders.** `<Box>` and `<Text>` follow a crossing by themselves, and only
when they hold a breakpoint object. Anywhere else, `useBreakpoint()` is the
subscription. It is what a recipe read by a component of your own needs, and what a
decision no style can carry uses (a different tree, one rail fewer).

**A declaration naming no breakpoint pays nothing.** No subscription, no rebuild,
and the same single cache entry it minted before there was an axis at all, the way a
recipe declaring no interaction states pays nothing for the state axis.

### Recipes: `sv`

`sv` is to React Native styles what `cva` is to Tailwind class strings: the
component's design as a declarative map, compiled once, resolved to frozen, cached
style objects.

```tsx
const chipVariants = sv({
  base: { row: true, center: true, radius: 'pill', _hover: { bg: 'white/16' } },
  variants: {
    tone: { neutral: { bg: 'white/10' }, accent: { bg: 'accentSoft' } },
    size: { sm: { py: 6, px: 12 }, tv: { py: 9, px: 18 } },
    active: { true: { bg: 'accent' } },      // boolean: `false` is the base look
  },
  compound: [{ when: { tone: 'accent', active: true }, style: { border: 'accentWash/45' } }],
  defaults: { tone: 'neutral', size: 'sm', active: false },
});
```

- **Interaction states live inside the layer they change**, under a `_` prefix:
  `_hover`, `_focus`, `_press`, `_disabled`. A variant's `_hover` beats the base's,
  so a variant cannot be given a rest fill and forgotten in the state tables.
  `<Focusable sv={...} vars={...}>` owns the live state and resolves the recipe
  against it.
- **Slots** name the parts of a multi-part component. `slots: { root, label, icon }`
  paints them all per variant. `svFor<{ root: StyleDecl; icon: Pick<IconProps,
  'color'> }>()` types a slot that feeds a component's PROPS, so a typo in a glyph
  colour is a compile error.
- **Types derive from the recipe.** `VariantProps<typeof chipVariants>` is the props
  slice (cva-style); `Variant<typeof chipVariants, 'size'>` is one group's union. Add
  an option and every consumer's type follows. There is no second list.
- **The workbench reads the recipe.** Controls and the variant matrix derive from
  `options`/`defaults`; add a variant and it appears with no story edit.

**The caller's `style` always wins.** Components place it after the resolved `root`,
so a one-off tweak at a call site never has to fight the component.

### `styles()`: the rest

For shapes that are not a variant of anything, `styles()` is `StyleSheet.create` in
the kit's vocabulary: named, registered, theme-aware, one lowercase binding.

```tsx
const s = styles({
  row: { row: true, align: 'center', gap: 6, px: 8, radius: 'sm' },
  label: { text: 'meta', color: 'textMuted' },
});
```

### Themes

Every token group (colours, radius, shadows, fonts, type roles, motion) lives in one
live store. `KROMA` is the default. A theme is created by restating any slice of it,
and everything derived, meaning type roles from specs plus families and the focus
ring from the accent, re-derives:

```tsx
import { createTheme, setTheme, ThemeProvider, useTheme } from '@kroma/ui/kit';

const ocean = createTheme({
  colors: { accent: '#3FB6F2', accentHover: '#66C6F5' },
  fonts: { display: 'Clash Display' },
  radius: { lg: 18 },
});

setTheme(ocean);                      // boot-time, before mount
<ThemeProvider theme={ocean}>…        // or runtime: remounts the subtree
```

Nothing re-resolves eagerly. Recipes, `styles()` and `<Box>` all key their caches on
the theme version and rebuild lazily on next use, so a swap costs one rebuild per
recipe actually rendered.

**New token names stay typed everywhere.** Token unions are `keyof` the base table
plus an augmentable registry, so a name added once is immediately legal, and
autocompleted, in `bg`, `border`, `color`, `/NN` alpha, `radius` and `font`:

```ts
declare module '@kroma/ui/tokens/colors' {
  interface ColorRegistry { brand: string }
}
createTheme({ colors: { brand: '#6C5CE7' } });   // → bg="brand", 'brand/40', …
```

`RadiusRegistry`, `ShadowRegistry`, `FontRegistry` and `TypeRoleRegistry` do the
same for their groups. Inside the kit no augmentation is needed: add the value to
`core/tokens/*` and the union already includes it.

For a token a style cannot carry (an `ActivityIndicator` colour, a chart paint), read
`useTheme()` in components, which subscribes, or `activeTheme()` at call time
elsewhere. Never capture either into a module constant.

## The 1920x1080 stage

`<TvStage>` is a fixed 1920x1080 canvas scaled to fit whatever the platform gives.
It is what makes the layout pixel-identical across targets whose native units
disagree:

| Target | What the platform reports |
| --- | --- |
| Tizen / webOS | 1920x1080 CSS px on a real panel |
| Apple TV | 1920x1080 points (the same on a 4K set: tvOS renders @2x) |
| Android TV | 960x540 dp at density 2.0 on a 1080p panel |

Without the stage, an Android TV renders the whole design at double size. With it,
one set of numbers is correct everywhere and the design is never re-tuned per
platform.

This is also why the kit contains no viewport units. Where the design says
`clamp(42px, 7.6vh, 82px)`, the code says `82`, with a comment: on a fixed 1080-tall
stage that is what it resolves to, and a `vh` would mean something different on each
target.

---

## Focus

`<Focusable>` is the one focusable primitive. Every remote-reachable control is one,
and it carries the signature 10-foot affordance: a solid amber ring plus a dark
lift, with an optional scale (1.06 for rail tiles, 1.05 for posters, 1.04 for the
primary action).

The spatial navigator (`react-tv-space-navigation`) owns directional movement on
every target, so a browser TV and an Apple TV move focus by the same rules rather
than by two engines that drift apart. What is platform-split is only how the remote
reaches it, which is what `useFocusNav()` wires, plus the keys the navigator has no
opinion about:

- **Native**: the remote arrives through `useTVEventHandler` and is posted to the
  navigator as directions (`lib/focus-remote.ts`). A full-screen transparent
  Pressable holds the platform's focus so the app hears the keys at all. Back and
  PlayPause are bridged separately, since the OS does not route them to a focusable.
- **Web**: the remote arrives as ordinary `keydown` events on the document and feeds
  the same navigator (`lib/focus-remote.web.ts`), which is why the library is in the
  browser bundles too. Back, the transport keys and a held OK's auto-repeats are
  handled beside it.
- **Phones**: the TV remote APIs only exist in the react-native-tvos fork, so
  everything remote-shaped degrades to a no-op and a `<Focusable>` is simply a touch
  target. Android's hardware back button still routes through `onBack`.

A modal declares a focus SCOPE (`<Dialog>` does this for you) so the D-pad cannot
wander back into the page behind it.

The press guard is shared. A press that navigates somewhere must not also fire the
control the new screen auto-focuses, so presses are ignored for 300 ms after every
screen mounts.

---

## Platform splits

Three mechanisms carry the entire cross-platform story.

**`.web.ts` / `.web.tsx` siblings.** Vite resolves them first
(`resolve.extensions`); Metro never sees them. `find src -name '*.web.ts*'` is the
live list. They fall into five reasons, and a new one needs to name its reason too:

| Reason | Where | Why the two platforms cannot share the file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Focus and the remote | `lib/focus-{nav,here,remote,root,transition}`, `player/lib/virtual-focus`, `player/hooks/use-player-keys` | one shared navigator owns movement, but the remote reaches it as TV events natively and as document keydowns on the web |
| Browser APIs with no RN equivalent | `lib/{portal,modal-portal,landmark,scroll-lock,drag-select,loop,wheel-pan,perf-memory}` | a DOM portal, a landmark role, pointer capture and `performance.memory` have no React Native spelling |
| Drawing primitives | `lib/{css,svg}`, `lib/icons/stroke-prop` | React Native prefixes gradients `experimental_`; react-native-svg vs the browser's own SVG parser |
| Motion | `lib/{progress-motion,splash-motion}`, `organisms/kroma-intro` | a CSS transition vs an `Animated` value |
| Layered surfaces | `molecules/{select,tooltip}`, `organisms/menu` | the web stacks them in a portal above the document; native stacks them in a modal host |

Each split is a whole-module swap, so the two halves must export the same names. A
split that exists only to change a few lines belongs in `Platform.OS` instead.

**`Platform.OS`, inside one file**, where the split is a single element rather than a
whole module. `<Img>` uses this: its leaf is a real `<img>` on the web, keeping
`loading="lazy"`, `fetchpriority` and `object-position`, which a 1000-poster grid on
a TV needs, and React Native's `<Image>` natively, while the container, the
cross-fade timing and the cover maths are shared.

**Injection**, for the one case where the split is not the kit's to make. `<Img>`
owns everything that is DESIGN: the container, the instant gradient placeholder, the
cross-fade timing, the cover maths. What it does not own is which decoder loads the
bytes. A TV wants React Native's `<Image>`; the mobile app wants `expo-image`, for
its memory and disk cache and its view recycling on a long scrolling list. So the
leaf is swappable, once, at app start:

```tsx
// clients/mobile/src/app/_layout.tsx
setImageBackend(expoImageBackend);
```

A backend declares `fades` so `<Img>` knows whether to run its own cross-fade or
stay out of the way of one the decoder already does. Nothing else in the kit or in
any screen changes.

---

## Icons

There is nothing to register. `<Icon name="wave-sine" />` works because
[Tabler](https://tabler.io/icons) has `IconWaveSine`, and `src/lib/icons/glyphs.ts`
translates one spelling into the other. No slug list, no generator, no generated
file. A name the package does not have draws the fallback (`help-circle`) instead of
crashing, which is what makes it safe to take an icon name from data. A
server-installed module names its glyph in a manifest, and no list could ever be
complete.

Tabler ships the same icons twice, with the same export names.
`@tabler/icons-react` draws DOM `<svg>`, `@tabler/icons-react-native` draws through
react-native-svg. `glyphs.ts` imports the React Native one, and every web bundler
aliases that specifier to the DOM one (`packages/bundler/src/rnw.ts`, the same trick
as `react-native` → `react-native-web`). So a browser gets native SVG and never
loads react-native-svg's runtime; native gets react-native-svg, where it is the only
way to draw at all. The one prop the two disagree on is the outline weight, which is
why `src/lib/icons/stroke-prop.ts` is itself a `.web` split.

The cost, measured: a namespace import cannot be tree-shaken, so left alone the
whole set ships, and the kit site went from 258 KB to 741 KB gzipped. A build-time
subset in `@kroma/ui/bundler` buys it back on every target: 299 of 6,250 glyphs
kept, and `<Icon>` costs 49 KB gzipped instead of 573 KB. `vite dev` is not subset
(`apply: 'build'`); Metro is, in both `start` and `export`.

The one app that needs the whole set is the gallery itself, and it fetches it.
`src/lib/icons/library.ts` merges all of Tabler and Tabler's own catalogue into the
drawable set when the icons page mounts, which took 2,529 KB of glyphs and 373 KB of
metadata out of the chunk the kit starts from. That door is web-only by nature,
since Metro has no dynamic import with a computed specifier and the webOS legacy
tier inlines every chunk back into one IIFE, so a Metro workbench still opts into
`icons: 'full'`.

---

## Tokens

`src/core/tokens/*.ts` is the single source of truth for the design, and it is also
what builds the default theme (see Styling: Themes). `kromaUI()` (`@kroma/ui/vite`)
emits the CSS custom properties the web and desktop clients consume from it at build
time, so there is no stylesheet copy that can drift.

Components never import token VALUES for styling. The vocabulary carries them by
name (`bg="accent"`, `radius="lg"`, `text: 'hero'`), which is what lets a theme reach
every declaration. What legitimately imports from `#ui/core/tokens` is the non-style
residue: `motion` timings, the `CANVAS` geometry, `gutter`, the chart palettes.

### Two form factors

The palette, the brand and the motion are shared by everything. What genuinely
differs between a phone and a television is scale: a phone is held at arm's length,
a TV is watched from three metres. So there is a second ramp, and it lives here
rather than in the mobile app, because it is a design decision and not drift:

```ts
import { mobileType, mobileSpace, mobileRadius } from '@kroma/ui/kit';

mobileType.title   // 28px / 800, where the 10-foot ramp says 44
mobileRadius.lg    // 18, rounder: close-up chrome reads sharp, not crisp
```

The 10-foot ramp is authored against the fixed 1920x1080 stage, so its numbers are
canvas px. The mobile ramp is authored against real device points and is read as-is,
with no stage in between.

---

## The workbench

```bash
bun run dev:kit        # http://localhost:5180
bun run kit:ios        # the same stories, on a phone
bun run kit:tv         # and on an Apple TV
```

Every component, its live controls, and its variant matrix. This is the kit's
Storybook, and it is not a separate application. It is a normal screen built from
the kit, so it runs in a browser, on an Apple TV and on a phone, with no manager
iframe, no builder abstraction and no addon protocol to keep alive. It is the only
component explorer in the project that can show you the design on the device that
actually has to render it. It also rides along on the TV shells, behind `?workbench`
(`bun run dev:tizen`, then `http://localhost:5174/?workbench`).

**Writing a story.** One document per component, `<component>.story.mdx` beside it,
with one typed export at the top:

```mdx
import { defineStory } from '@kroma/workbench/story';
import { Chip } from './chip';

export const story = defineStory({ group: 'Actions', component: Chip, args: { label: 'HDR' } });

A small, non-pressable statement of fact.
```

Passing `variants` (the component's own `sv`) is the whole trick. A compiled `sv`
carries its declaration, so the workbench reads the axes straight off the component:
every control and every matrix row is derived rather than written. Storybook needs
`argTypes` or a docgen pass to get there, and both can drift from the component.
This cannot, because it *is* the component. Add a variant, and it appears in the
panel and in the matrix with no story edit at all.

The name comes from the file (`chip.story.mdx` → `Chip`); write `name` only where
that derivation is wrong. Naming the `component` is the shorter spelling and the
safer one: the workbench renders `<Chip {...args} />` itself, so the args ARE the
props and a control that moves nothing cannot be written. Write a `render` instead
when the story has to compose a provider, a surface to sit on, or two of the
component side by side, and take the args as its argument.

Anything that is not a variant goes in `args`, where the control is inferred from
the value's type. A second take on the component is a `<Scene>` in the prose, and
the take it holds decides whether the controls keep driving it.

**Writing a demo.** A demo is the other half of the job: a worked example with its
own state and several components in it, rather than the same component under other
args. A form that validates, a code screen that rejects a code. It is one file, and
it declares nothing:

```tsx
// components/atoms/button/button.detail-actions.demo.tsx
import { Box } from '#ui/components/atoms/box';
import { Button } from './button';

/**
 * The row from a title screen: the primary action, two stateful toggles and a
 * demoted extra. Press the `outline` buttons to see the amber `active` fill.
 *
 * @name Detail actions
 */
export default function DetailActions() {
  return <Box row gap={12}>{/* ... */}</Box>;
}
```

The file name says which story it belongs to (`<story-id>.<demo>.demo.tsx`) and what
the tab is called. The doc comment above the export is the prose (`@name` renames
the tab, any other tag is ignored). And the file itself is the code sample, read as
text by the bundler, so the sample cannot drift from the example the way a
hand-copied template literal did. Reading a file as text is a Vite primitive
(`?raw`) that Metro has no answer for, so on Apple TV and Android TV a demo renders
with no code panel rather than a stale one. See `packages/workbench/src/demos.ts`.

**Writing the prose.** The document IS the story file, which is why it is MDX:
everything markdown and GFM have, plus live components in the middle of a sentence,
plus the `<Scene>`, `<Do>` and `<Dont>` blocks the workbench hands every document.

```mdx
import { ListRow } from './list-row'

One D-pad stop per row, and a pointer-sized hit area.

<ListRow.Root>
  <ListRow.Label>Qualité</ListRow.Label>
  <ListRow.Hint>1080p</ListRow.Hint>
</ListRow.Root>
```

Unlike a demo's code panel this does NOT thin out on a television. MDX is a plain
compiler, so Vite runs it as a plugin and Metro runs it as a transformer, and
`@kroma/workbench`'s `mdx.tsx` maps every HTML element MDX emits to a kit component.
Its own test holds that map to a real compile, because a missing element is a crash
on the one platform that cannot render it. Helpers a document needs go in
`<component>.fixtures.tsx` beside it: MDX is for the writing, TypeScript stays in
TypeScript.

**Stories, demos and pages are discovered, never listed.** Drop a `*.story.mdx`, a
`*.demo.tsx` or a `*.page.mdx` anywhere under `src/` and it is in the workbench.
There is no registry to regenerate and no generated file to fall behind. Discovery
needs a bundler primitive, and both bundlers resolve theirs relative to the file
that writes it, so the glob lives in the HOST rather than in the kit:
`apps/kit/src/stories.web.ts` writes `import.meta.glob`, `stories.ts` beside it
writes `require.context`, and both hand the result to `@kroma/workbench`. Every
state is a real path (`/story/button/matrix`).

**The toolbar switches themes.** KROMA plus three restatements (Ocean, Ember,
Terminal). A control that stays amber under Ocean is bypassing the vocabulary.

**One screen, three widths.** The workbench is also the kit's own responsive test.
`packages/workbench/src/layout.ts` is a pure function of the window, and the regions
*move* rather than shrink. Past 1240pt the list, the canvas and the inspector are
three columns; below that the inspector docks under the canvas as a wrapping row;
below 880pt the list becomes a drawer over the canvas and the dock collapses to its
titlebar, so the component keeps the room on a phone.

The workbench is `@kroma/workbench`, a package of its own, and it knows no design
system: a host hands it the stories, the wordmark and the app context. This package
supplies KROMA's half of that in `src/workbench-config.tsx`, which is a plain object
rather than a call, because calling `defineWorkbench()` here would make `@kroma/ui`
import `@kroma/workbench`, which imports `@kroma/ui`. Each host spreads it and adds
its own discovery and router: `apps/kit/src/config{,.web}.tsx`,
`packages/tv/src/workbench{,.web}.tsx`, `clients/mobile/src/app/workbench.tsx`.

It is a tool rather than part of the library, and it drags in every story: an app
that is not being inspected should not pay for it. The TV entry loads it lazily,
behind the `?workbench` flag.

**Screenshots.**

```bash
bun run build:tizen && bun run shots     # -> packages/ui/.shots/
```

One PNG per story, captured from the real build by the Chrome already on the
machine: no Playwright, no test runner, no new dependency. The workbench's `?shot`
mode renders the story alone, with no sidebar, header or panel, so what lands in the
file is the component.

It captures; it does not compare. A pixel diff across Chrome versions is mostly
noise, so these are made to be *looked at* and dropped into a review, not gated on.
Behaviour is what the unit tests are for.

## Testing

```bash
bunx vitest run packages/ui
```

Component tests render through react-native-web in jsdom, which is exactly what the
browser targets ship, and assert the DOM that comes out. Pure logic (the variant
helper, the layout resolver, the cover-rect maths, the focus geometry) is tested
directly.

Two things worth knowing when writing them:

- react-native-web compiles most styles into atomic CSS classes and keeps inline
  styles only where a value is dynamic, so assert through `getComputedStyle` rather
  than the `style` attribute.
- A `<Focusable>` renders a real `<button>`, so the browser's own activation
  behaviour turns Enter into a click. jsdom implements neither, so a test stands in
  for the browser with an explicit `fireEvent.click`.
