//! Push delivery: getting a notification onto a device whose app is closed.
//!
//! Three transports, one delivery loop. Each [`transports`] module answers two
//! questions the shared code cannot ask itself how to build this device's
//! request, and which failures mean the device is gone while the loop below
//! owns everything else: preferences, the success/failure streak, and evicting
//! dead endpoints.
//!
//! Web Push is the one that needs nothing from anyone: the server mints its own
//! VAPID keypair, so a NAS on a home LAN can push to a browser with no account
//! anywhere. APNs and FCM cannot work that way an Apple auth key and a
//! Firebase service account are per-developer secrets so those are configured
//! by the operator (see the admin settings) and simply stay inactive until they
//! are. A server with none of them configured does no push work at all.
//!
//! Delivery is best-effort and never blocks the thing that caused it: a push
//! that fails leaves the in-app notification exactly where it was.
