// Where "play this now" lands.
//
// While this phone is driving a TV, Play means play THERE - the whole point of
// being connected. Sending it to the phone's own player instead is the bug that
// makes casting feel broken: the bar says "Playing on Salon" and the film starts
// in your hand.
//
// One helper so every entry point (a title page, a hero, an episode row, a
// search result) makes the same decision. Downloads deliberately do NOT use it:
// an offline file is on this device, and playing it here is the point.
