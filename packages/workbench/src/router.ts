// The routing PORT, and the two adapters that need no dependency to implement it.
//
// The workbench has to run in four places that disagree about what a URL even
// is: a standalone site that owns the address bar, a TV shell squatting on
// someone else's page behind `?workbench`, an Apple TV with no address bar at
// all, and a phone screen mounted INSIDE another router that already owns the
// history. A package that picked one of those and called it routing would be
// broken in the other three - and one that sniffed the environment to guess
// between them would be broken wherever the sniff came out wrong.
//
// So it does neither. The shell states what it needs - tell me where I am, take
// me somewhere - and the host plugs in something that can do it. Everything else
// about routing (whether there is history, what the path means, whether the
// address bar is even ours to write) stops being this package's business.
//
//   pathRouter          the default. REAL PATHS - `/story/button/matrix` - on the
//                       History API alone, no router dependency. Degrades to
//                       plain state where there is no DOM.
//   memoryRouter        never touches the address bar. For a mount nested inside
//                       a host router, for native, and for tests.
//   tanstackRouter      see ./tanstack. Real paths too, but through the HOST's
//                       router rather than a second one, so there is only ever
//                       one in the tree.
//   searchParamsRouter  `?story=&view=`. For a shell that CANNOT do path
//                       routing - a TV app loaded from the filesystem, where
//                       there is no server to fall back to index.html and a
//                       reload of `/story/button` is a 404.
//
// The port is ONE HOOK returning a tuple, deliberately shaped like `useState`:
// an adapter is then an ordinary custom hook, obeying the ordinary rules, and
// there is no lifecycle to explain. A host with an idea of its own - a state
// machine, a query string it already owns, a native deep-link scheme - writes
// about fifteen lines and plugs that in instead.
