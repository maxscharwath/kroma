// Apple TV has no microphone an app may open, so Siri IS the voice input here:
// the user holds the remote's Siri button and says "cherche Blade Runner dans
// KROMA", the system resolves it against the app (KromaMediaIntents, in the
// local siri-search module) and the spoken title arrives here.
//
// Both arrival times are covered, because Siri does not care whether the app was
// running: a request that launched the app is waiting as a pending query, and
// one spoken while it was open comes in as an event.
//
// The same door also opens for `kroma://search?q=...`. That is not decoration:
// Siri does not exist in the tvOS simulator, so a URL is the only way to
// exercise this whole path (native bridge -> requestSearch -> the search screen)
// anywhere but on a real Apple TV with a real remote:
//
//   xcrun simctl openurl <udid> 'kroma://search?q=blade%20runner'
