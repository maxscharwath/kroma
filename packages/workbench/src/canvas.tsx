 * `getBoundingClientRect`, which is POST-transform - so a component that MEASURES
 * ITSELF, placed inside a `scale(0.8)`, is told it has 880pt while its children
 * still lay out against 1100. <VirtualRail> derives its tile pitch, its scroll
 * offset and the position of its edge scrims from that number, and at 80% drew a
 * row built for an 880pt viewport into an 1100pt one: tiles sliced at the ends,
 * black scrims sitting over artwork instead of at the row's edges.
 *
 * So a story that says how wide it is never gets scaled. What it gets instead
 * depends on which of the three things it said (see `StoryWidth`):
 *
 *   'fill' / {}         the stage's own width. Dynamic: resize the window and the
 *                       component re-measures, which is the whole point.
 *   { min, max }        the same, clamped. Below `min` the stage SCROLLS rather
 *                       than measuring the component at a width no screen has.
 *   a number            that width, scrolling when the stage is narrower.
 *   absent              nothing to honour: the canvas measures the content and
