// Detail-page theme playback, native (Apple TV / Android TV / phones).
//
// The browser half (themeAudio.web.ts) is built on `new Audio()`, which does not
// exist in React Native: reaching for it threw a ReferenceError that the runtime
// turned into SIGABRT, so opening a series page killed the app outright. This is
// the same feature, built on what the native targets actually have.
//
// expo-video rather than expo-audio: its pod is ALREADY linked into the tvOS and
// mobile binaries (the player uses it), so a theme plays without adding a native
// module and without anyone having to rebuild before they can sign in again. A
// player with no view attached is audio-only, which is what a theme is.
//
// Everything the DESIGN specifies is shared with the web half in
// ./lib/theme-audio: the quiet level, the fade timings, the mute preference.
// Only the machinery differs.
