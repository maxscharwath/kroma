// The window is RIGHT-ANCHORED and its step is fixed. The previous version spread
// whatever samples it happened to have across the full width (`step = W / (n-1)`),
// so for the first 40 s of a stream the trace stretched horizontally as history
// accumulated: the line appeared to move because the axis was moving under it,
// which is the one thing a trend chart must never do. Here the newest sample is
// always at the right edge, one sample is always the same number of pixels, and a
// short history simply has not reached the left edge yet.
