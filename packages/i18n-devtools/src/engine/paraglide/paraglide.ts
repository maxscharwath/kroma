 * Each message compiles to a standalone function and the runtime has no hook
 * a message call passes through, so nothing can reach the text unless the app
 * renders through something this adapter owns. That is `messages`, and the
 * app has to import it in place of paraglide's own:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { m as compiled } from './paraglide/messages';
 * import * as runtime from './paraglide/runtime';
 *
 * export const engine = paraglide({ runtime, messages: compiled });
 * export const m = engine.messages;
 * ```
 *
 * Handing the namespace to a function retains every message, so nothing
 * tree-shakes while the wrapper is in the graph. Only `m.hello()` is ever
 * seen, never a named `import { hello }`, which resolves straight to the
 * compiled function.
 *
 * `from` names the locale a message rendered in and never a fallback, because
 * the fallback chain is compiled into the function body and leaves nothing to
 * read from outside. And `from` is never absent, because a key no catalog
 * answers is a type error rather than a miss at runtime.
