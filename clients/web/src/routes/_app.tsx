 * What the television calls this browser in its list of remotes.
 *

 * give, from the one table that knows a UA (shared/lib/device) - which matters
 * here rather than being tidiness: `CriOS` and `FxiOS` are Chrome and Firefox on
 * an iPhone, and a fourth hand-rolled copy called them both Safari, so two
 * different phones drove a set under one name.
 *
 * Read once, at module scope: a User-Agent cannot change, and this is `null` on
 * the server (the client re-evaluates it on hydration, which is where the value
 * is actually sent from).
