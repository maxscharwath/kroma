/**
 * Finding the server by ASKING the network, instead of guessing at it.
 *
 * See the Android half for the full story; the short version is that the server
 * has advertised `_kroma._tcp` (server/modules/tv.kroma.mdns) since forever and
 * nothing on this side ever listened, so the app fell back to sweeping the /24
 * on port 4040 - which cannot find a server behind a reverse proxy on 443 no
 * matter how long it looks.
 *
 * `NWBrowser` rather than `NetServiceBrowser`: the latter is deprecated, and the
 * former is what Apple supports on tvOS. The wrinkle is that a browse result is
 * an opaque `.service` endpoint, NOT a host and port - Bonjour deliberately
 * defers resolution - so each hit is resolved by opening a connection to it and
 * reading the path the system actually took.
 *
 * Browsing at all requires `NSBonjourServices` to list `_kroma._tcp` in
 * Info.plist. It already does (see app.json); without it this returns nothing
 * and says nothing about why.
