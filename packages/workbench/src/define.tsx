// `defineWorkbench`: the whole of a host's configuration, as data.
//
// The shell takes props, which is the right shape for a component and the wrong
// shape for a config file: a host that wanted a locale switch had to hold the
// locale in state, build a lens out of it, build a provider around it, memoise
// both, and keep the two ends agreeing. That is thirty lines of hooks in a file
// whose entire job is to say four facts, and every host would write the same
// thirty lines slightly differently.
//
// So this takes the facts and returns the COMPONENT. Everything with a lifecycle
// - the state behind a provider, the lens that changes it, the router adapter
// that must not be rebuilt per render - happens in here, once, correctly. A
// config file becomes declarative: no hooks, no memos, nothing to get wrong.
//
//   export const Kit = defineWorkbench({
//     stories: STORIES,
//     title: 'Kit',
//     brand: <Logo size={19} />,
//     provider: {
//       name: 'Language',
//       glyph: 'language',
//       values: [{ value: 'en', label: 'English' }, { value: 'fr', label: 'Français' }],
//       render: (locale, onLocaleChange, children) => (
//         <I18nProvider locale={locale} onLocaleChange={onLocaleChange}>{children}</I18nProvider>
//       ),
//     },
//   });
//
// `<Kit />` is then the whole site.
