// Test helpers for anything that renders kit components.
//
// A <Focusable> is a node of the spatial navigator, and a node needs a navigator
// - the router gives every screen one through <FocusScope>. A test that renders
// a control on its own has no router, so it mounts the same scope here.
//
// It provides translations for the same reason. `useT()` THROWS outside an
// <I18nProvider>, which is not a bug: a component that renders a string with no
// locale to render it in is a real mistake in an app. But it means the player
// chrome, the hints and the dialogs cannot be rendered by a test - or by the
// workbench's story smoke test - without one. So this helper gives a tree
// everything a real screen would: a navigator and a language.
//
// Kept out of the kit's public surface: this is for tests, not for screens.
