// Where a row should sit once the selection has moved.

// The rule every television row actually follows, and the one the navigator
// library cannot express: KEEP THE OFFSET unless the selection is coming within
// a margin of an edge. Its three behaviours all compute the offset as a pure
// function of the focused index - the selection is pinned left, pinned right, or
// paged - so the row either scrolls under a selection that never moves, or does
// not scroll until the selection is already flush against the edge with nothing
// visible beyond it.
//
// What is wanted instead: the highlight travels freely across the middle of the
// row, and the row only moves when the highlight approaches either end, keeping
// `margin` of look-ahead past it in the direction of travel. That depends on
// where the row already is - it is hysteresis, not a formula on the index - which
// is why this takes the offset as an input as well as returning one.

 * third tile is sliced by the edge and the row looks broken rather than
 * scrollable. Rounding to the nearest whole count and sharing the width out
 * gives three tiles of 130 - the same design, sized for the screen it is on.
 *
 * Rounds rather than floors: a viewport half a tile short of another column
 * looks better slightly tighter than with a column's worth of space to spare.
 *
 * The result is a WHOLE NUMBER of pixels, and that is the fix for the seams. A
 * 683pt strip over three columns is 227.667 - so every tile boundary landed on a
 * third of a pixel, Chrome rounded each one on its own, and the row grew hairline
 * gaps between tiles and a sliced sliver at each end (which is what made the
 * poster scrims look like they were not flush to the card edges). A whole-pixel
 * pitch leaves up to `columns - 1` pixels of the strip unused, which nobody can
 * see, instead of a fractional edge on every tile, which everybody could.
