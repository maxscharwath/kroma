// Metro for an Expo client living inside this bun workspace.
//
// Shared by the native TV app and the mobile app, because both face the same
// three problems and had started solving them in two drifting copies.
//
//   1. The @kroma/* packages ship raw TypeScript source and live OUTSIDE the
//      client directory, so Metro has to watch the repo root and be told where
//      the node_modules are. Without this the app cannot import @kroma/ui.
//
//   2. There must be exactly ONE physical copy of React Native in the bundle.
//      This is the big one, and it is not theoretical: every third-party native
//      package (expo-video, expo-font, react-native-svg...) declares
//      `react-native` as a peer, and the installer satisfies those peers with
//      the plain `react-native` package rather than with the alias this repo
//      pins (`npm:react-native-tvos`). The JavaScript then comes from mainline
//      React Native while the app BINARY is compiled against the tvOS fork.
//      Nothing errors: it simply behaves as if the TV never existed. No view is
//      focusable, so the remote does nothing, and `TVFocusGuideView`,
//      `TVEventControl` and `useTVEventHandler` are all undefined.
//
//      So `react-native` is pinned here to the client's own copy, for every
//      module in the graph. It is also what keeps a native module's JS half in
//      step with the half that was compiled into the binary.
//
//   3. `.web.*` files are the browser half of the kit's platform splits. Metro
//      already prefers the platform-specific and plain files, but pinning the
//      resolution keeps a stray `.web` file from ever reaching a native build.
