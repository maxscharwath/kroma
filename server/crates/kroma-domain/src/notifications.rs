//! Notifications: durable, per-user messages about things the user asked to be
//! told about (a request they filed was approved, a film they wanted arrived, a
//! report they need to triage). Pure data (serde); persistence lives in
//! `crate::db::notifications`, delivery in `crate::services::notify`.
//!
//! A stored notification holds an **i18n key plus params**, never rendered text,
//! so a user who switches language re-reads their whole history in the new one.
//! The wire shape below is the RENDERED form: the server resolves keys against
//! the recipient's locale on the way out, exactly like `api::error::lerr` does.
//!
//! The JSON shape here is a public contract web/mobile/TV clients depend on it,
//! so field names and casing must not drift. Timestamps are epoch milliseconds.
