// The kit app: the same workbench the site serves, compiled by React Native.
//
// It exists so that "inspect the kit on the device that actually has to display
// it" is its OWN app rather than a branch inside every product shell. The TV
// client used to carry the whole design system behind an env flag purely to
// offer this; now it carries the product and nothing else, and this is what you
// launch at a simulator.
//
// One app, both shapes. `Platform.isTV` is a build-time fact on the tvOS fork
// (the same bundle is never both), so this is a fork in the shell rather than a
// runtime feature check:
//
//   television  the workbench sits on <TvStage>, the fixed 1920x1080 canvas
//               every 10-foot screen is authored against - so the kit is being
//               judged at the size and distance it ships at.
//   phone       no stage: the point of the phone build is the REAL point grid,
//               where a 44pt hit target is 44pt.
