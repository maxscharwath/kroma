# `tauri build` links the shell against Homebrew's libmpv via an ABSOLUTE install
# name (otool -L shows /opt/homebrew/opt/mpv/lib/libmpv.2.dylib), which only exists
# on a dev box. dylibbundler copies libmpv AND everything it transitively pulls (the
# ffmpeg decode stack) into Contents/Frameworks and rewrites every install name to
# @executable_path/../Frameworks, making the .app self-contained.
#
# Run AFTER `tauri build`, BEFORE codesign/notarize: rewriting the Mach-O load
# commands invalidates any prior signature, so the release workflow signs the .app
# (deep) only after this step. Idempotent-ish: re-running overwrites the dir.
