// <TextArea>: the multi-line entry, in both of the modes a 10-foot app needs.
//
// It is <TextField>'s taller sibling and shares its whole shape on purpose: the
// same bordered box, the same calm accent border for focus, the same red edge
// for a rejected value, the same controlled (`value`) or uncontrolled
// (`defaultValue`) contract, and the same two modes - a real TextInput on a
// shell with a physical keyboard, and a NON-focusable display of the value plus
// a blinking caret on a television, where typing goes through the on-screen
// keyboard and nothing should invite a tap that summons the platform IME.
//
// What it adds is height. `rows` is the floor it opens at, and the field GROWS
// with what is typed into it up to `maxRows`, past which it scrolls instead of
// pushing the rest of the form off the screen. That is shadcn's
// `field-sizing-content` behaviour, and it is worth the machinery: a note typed
// into a fixed two-line slot is written half-blind, with the beginning of it
// scrolled out of sight.
//
// The growth is measured in exactly one place per platform. A browser sizes the
// control itself through `field-sizing` (no measure, no re-render); native has
// no such property, so there the entry reports its content height and this
// component sets the height it clamps to.
