// Values are plain strings so they drop straight into a React Native StyleSheet

// and the old webOS tier could not parse them either.

 * from each other, including by a colourblind reader, on the surface they are
 * drawn on. So they are not eyeballed - the set is checked against the six
 * standard palette checks (OKLCH lightness band, chroma floor, adjacent CVD
 * separation under protan/deutan/tritan, normal-vision separation, and contrast
 * against the surface) and passes all of them on the player's stats card in both
 * the darkest and the brightest frame it can sit over.
 *
 * Assign by POSITION and never cycle: a reader who learned that blue is
 * bandwidth must not find it repainted when a series drops out.
 *
 * THREE slots, and that is a measured limit rather than a placeholder. The band
 * the checks leave usable here is narrow - deeper than the badge palette, because
 * a 2px trace reads lighter than a filled pill of the same hue and the light end
 * is where CVD separation fails - and no fourth hue fits in it: every candidate
 * tried collapsed against blue or against green under deutan/protan (best was
 * ΔE 6.7, inside the 6-8 floor band). So a fourth series does not get a fourth
 * colour. It gets its own chart, which is the correct answer anyway - facet
 * rather than invent a hue that a colourblind reader cannot separate.
