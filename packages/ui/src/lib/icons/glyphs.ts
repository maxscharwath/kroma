// The icon set: all of Tabler, resolved by name, with a fallback.
//
// There is no list here and no generator. `<Icon name="wave-sine" />` finds
// `IconWaveSine` in the package, and a name the package does not have draws the
// fallback instead of crashing - which is what makes icon names safe to take
// from DATA (a server-installed module names its glyph in a manifest, a
// catalogue row can carry one), where no list could ever be complete.
//
// How one namespace serves a television and a browser
// ---------------------------------------------------
// Tabler ships the same icons twice, with the same export names: `@tabler/
// icons-react` draws DOM <svg>, `@tabler/icons-react-native` draws through
// react-native-svg. This file imports the React Native one; every web bundler
// aliases that specifier to the DOM one (clients/tv-build/rnw.ts, the same trick
// as `react-native` -> `react-native-web`). So a browser gets native SVG and
// never loads react-native-svg's runtime, and native gets react-native-svg,
// where it is the only way to draw at all. The one prop they spell differently
// is the outline weight; see stroke-prop.ts.
//
// What this costs, measured
// -------------------------
// A namespace import cannot be tree-shaken, so the whole set ships: the kit site
// went from 258 KB to 740 KB gzipped (850 KB -> 3.4 MB raw). Lazy loading does
// not recover it on the targets that care - Metro has no dynamic import with a
// computed specifier, and the webOS legacy tier inlines every chunk back into
// one IIFE - so it would only help the modern web tier, at the price of ~5800
// chunks and glyphs arriving over the network mid-render. The trade accepted
// here is bytes for the guarantee that any name resolves; going back to a
// hand-written map is a small, local change to this file alone.
