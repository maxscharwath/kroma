// The workbench config for the NATIVE kit app — the Metro mirror of
// `config.web.tsx`.
//
// It differs from the web half in exactly one line, and it is the same line the
// TV shells differ by: the ROUTER. A phone or a television has no address bar to
// keep a story in step with, so there is nothing for the default path routing to
// write to and `memoryRouter` holds the location in memory instead.
//
// Everything else - the title, the mark, the locale provider - is
// `KROMA_WORKBENCH`, shared with the site and with the app shells.
