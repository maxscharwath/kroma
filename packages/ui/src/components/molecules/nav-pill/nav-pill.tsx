// <NavPill>: the floating section switcher, as ONE component.
//
// A capsule of icon + label items where the current section sits in its own
// amber lens. The Apple TV's top nav and the iPhone's bottom tab bar are this
// same design at two distances - and until this file they were two
// implementations (packages/tv NavPill, clients/mobile PillTabBar) drifting a
// padding at a time. The kit owns the capsule; the apps own what pressing an
// item MEANS.
//
// The API is compound, shadcn-fashion: the root carries the shared decisions
// (metrics, label policy, the fill) down by context, and each item is its own
// child rather than a row in a config array - so a host can wrap one item in a
// badge, ref the last one for focus wiring, or put something that is not an
// item in the row, none of which an `items` prop can say.
//
//   <NavPill size="tv">
//     <NavPillItem icon="home" label="Home" active onPress={goHome} />
//     <NavPillItem icon="search" label="Search" onPress={goSearch} />
//   </NavPill>
//
// The two sizes are the two distances. `tv` keeps every label - a viewer three
// metres away is reading, not tapping, and constant labels mean the capsule
// never changes width under the travelling ring. `sm` (a thumb on glass) shows
// the label only on the active item, which is how the bar fits a phone.
//
// The LENS TRAVELS. The amber is one view owned by the root, not a background
// each item paints: items report where they sit, and when the section changes
// the lens springs from the old item's box to the new one's - the morph a
// segmented control taught everyone to expect, and the reason the root has to
// know the geometry at all. On the kit's usual split: a CSS transition where
// react-native-web would otherwise run a rAF loop, `Animated` elsewhere (the
// JS driver, deliberately - left and width are layout properties the native
// driver cannot carry, and a 260ms one-shot is what the JS driver is for).
//
// The fill is a solid translucency, not a blur: the kit stays free of platform
// blur dependencies. A platform that composites blur on the GPU fills the
// `backdrop` slot - the iPhone with its own <BlurView>, the TV chrome with the
// kit's <Frost> (which is CSS backdrop-filter on the browsers, ignored for
// free by the legacy panels, and the shell's registered blur view on native) -
// and the fill thins to let it read.
//
// On glass the capsule is also a SLIDER. A tap switches sections as it always
// has, but a finger that lands and then travels is captured by the capsule
// itself: the lens - and the amber ink with it - chases the finger from item to
// item as a PREVIEW, and lifting commits whatever it rests on, the drag the
// native tab bar taught thumbs to expect. Committing on the RELEASE rather than
// on every crossing is what keeps the gesture calm: `active` never flips while
// the finger is down, so no label swaps and no rect reflows happen under a
// thumb that is still moving - the host navigates once, when it lets go. A
// television never sees any of this: the remote has no finger.
//
// The root's options bend these defaults without forking the design: `labels`
// overrides the size's label policy (`none` is the icon-only bar), `slide`
// turns the gesture off for a tap-only host, and `onPreview` reports each
// crossing as it happens - the hook a host hangs its selection haptics on,
// since the kit itself stays free of platform haptics dependencies.
