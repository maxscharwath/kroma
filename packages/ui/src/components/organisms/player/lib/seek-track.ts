// between the two - the playhead, the storyboard preview, and the drag itself -
// has to use the SAME conversion, or they disagree on screen.
//
// They did: the segments were laid out with an equal `flex` each while the
// playhead was placed at `cur / dur` of the whole track, so with chapters of
// different lengths (a 96s cold open next to a 53-minute act) the playhead sat
// nowhere near the end of its own fill.
