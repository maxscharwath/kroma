// The NATIVE playback backend (Apple TV, Android TV): expo-video.
//
// The browser targets have three engines to choose between (a bare <video> plus
// hls.js, Samsung's AVPlay plane, mpv on the desktop shell) because each is the
// only way to reach a particular decoder
// from inside a WebView. A native app has no such problem: expo-video IS the
// platform player (AVPlayer on tvOS, Media3/ExoPlayer on Android TV), so this
// backend is one engine and the decision collapses to "direct-play the original
// file, or ask the server to remux it".
//
// See backend.web.ts for the browser half. The hook that drives playback
// (useDirectPlayback) imports from './backend' and never learns which it got.

 * stream-copied) and we play that instead.
 *
 * It takes the OS because the two native players disagree about containers, and
 * the guess is not free. This used to ask `avplayDirectPlayable`, which answers
 * for Samsung's AVPlay: that demuxes Matroska, AVFoundation does not, so every
 * MKV on Apple TV opened a player that was certain to fail, waited for it to say
 * "Cannot Open", and only then asked the server - two seconds of black screen
 * per title, and a released-player race in expo-video behind it.
 *
 * The engine preference is honoured only where it is meaningful: `remux` forces
 * the server path even for a file the device could have opened directly. The
 * browser-only prefs (avplay / mpv / webview) have no native
 * counterpart and fall through to the automatic decision.
