// The story format.
//
// A story is a plain object describing how to render one component and what
// about it is worth changing. It is deliberately smaller than Storybook's CSF:
// there is no meta/export-per-variation split, no decorators, no parameters, no
// addon protocol. One default export per component, next to the component.
//
// What replaces the missing machinery is `sv`. A component's variant map is
// already the single source of truth for its design, so passing it to a story
// gives the workbench the controls AND the variant matrix with nothing written
// by hand. Storybook needs argTypes or a docgen pass to get there, and both can
// drift from the component; this cannot, because it IS the component.
//
//   export default story({
//     name: 'Button',
//     group: 'Actions',
//     variants: buttonVariants,
//     args: { label: 'Play' },
//     render: (props) => <Button {...props} />,
//   });
