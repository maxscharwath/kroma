// The cinematic brand intro, native (Apple TV / Android TV).
//
// The same film the browser shells play through @kroma/ui's <KromaIntro>, on the
// one player a native TV has: expo-video, which is AVPlayer on tvOS and
// Media3/ExoPlayer on Android TV. What is deliberately NOT ported is that
// component's pure-CSS fallback scene. It exists for browsers with no HEVC
// decoder, and a native television always has one, so a film that fails to open
// here simply hands off to the app instead of playing a second intro.
//
// An overlay, not a gate: the app tree is already mounted and fetching behind
// it, exactly as on the web. That is also why the intro HOLDS the remote for its
// lifetime (see holdInput): native has no capture phase, so without it the press
// that skips the film would also activate the card focused underneath, and the
// intro would fade out onto a screen nobody chose.
//
// See BrandIntro.web.tsx for the browser half.
