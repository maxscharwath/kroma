// The performance bench: the app's real rendering path, without the app.

// A television's cost is rows of artwork and a focus that moves through them,
// and measuring that used to need a signed-in server, a populated library and a
// TV on the desk. This mounts the SAME components the browse screens use - the
// navigator, <Rail>, <MediaCard>, the focus ring and its transition - over
// generated data, so a number is reproducible on any machine and comparable
// between two commits.
//
// Served by `clients/tv-build/perf-bench.ts`, which drives it with the remote's
// keys and reads `KROMA_PERF`. Size it with `?rails=8&tiles=20`.
