// Samsung wants exactly 4 at 1920x1080 (JPG, <=500kB); LG takes up to 6 at
// 1920x1080 or 1280x720. Shooting the real build rather than mocking a page

// The TV router is a MEMORY history ("a TV has no address bar" - see
// packages/tv/src/app/router.tsx), so a screen is reached by pressing the keys a
// viewer would press, not by navigating to a URL. That makes the sequence below
// depend on the catalogue: how many rails home has, how many tiles precede the
// one worth photographing. Tune SCREENS against your own server, using the
// on-screen text this prints after every step to see where focus actually is.
