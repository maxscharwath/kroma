/**
 * Discreet top-left "stats for nerds" overlay (§9): what the stream actually is,
 * versus what was asked for.
 *
 * ONE layout, whatever the platform reports. It used to have two - a stacked list
 * under a dozen rows and a wrapped multi-column grid over it - which meant the
 * lean native-TV snapshot and the rich web one were separate designs that drifted
 * independently and had to be reviewed twice. The single shape here is: a SUMMARY
 * that answers the first question (is this direct-playing?) as a headline plus a
 * wrapping run of label-value pairs, the live CHARTS, then the grouped
 * diagnostics as equal columns. A surface that reports less simply fills fewer of
 * those - the type, rhythm and width never change, so there is one design to
 * keep right.
 *
 * The card is near-opaque rather than the frosted 0.74 it was. This panel exists
 * to be READ over moving video, and its chart colours are validated against a
 * known surface - both of which a translucent card that samples an arbitrary
 * frame quietly breaks.
 *
 * Read-only: it never drives the engine, so it carries no D-pad focus beyond the
 * close X.

 * these take is freshly allocated on each poll: a default memo would compare
 * new arrays and never hit. React.memo with an explicit comparator says that
 * out loud, where a useMemo keyed on a hand-built signature string only implied
