// Directional seeking on the scrub bar.
//
// A press used to be a flat ten seconds, committed immediately. On a two-hour
// film that is a cursor that barely moves, and holding the direction issued a
// real seek per repeat - a stutter of re-anchors instead of travel.
//
// So the two gestures are told apart, the way a remote's users expect:
//
//   TAP   a single press is exactly TAP_STEP, precise and predictable.
//   HOLD  a press the remote is auto-repeating becomes a continuous scrub whose
//         SPEED ramps the longer it is held - slow enough at first to stop on a
//         scene, then fast enough to cross a whole film.
//
// The cursor moves the whole time (the scrub bar previews the running target)
// and exactly ONE real seek is issued, once the presses stop. That matters on
// the anchored HLS master, where every seek is a new server anchor.
