// <FocusScope>: the navigator for one screen, and the groups inside it.
//
// Every screen is wrapped in one by the router, and it does two things: it holds
// the spatial tree for that screen, and it makes sure exactly ONE navigator is
// listening to the remote at a time. A screen that is pushed over another stays
// mounted underneath, and two live navigators would both act on the same press.
//
// SHARED, on purpose. Only the screen root differs between the targets - the web
// must contribute no box, native needs a focusable key host and a `flex: 1` view
// - so only the root is forked, into focus-root.tsx / focus-root.web.tsx. This
// file used to be forked whole, which meant <FocusRegion> and <FocusColumn> had
// two homes with nothing linking them: a prop added to one compiled fine and
// silently gave the browser TVs different focus behaviour from the native ones,
// which is the class of bug the shared navigator was adopted to eliminate.

 * row lands on the fifth key of the next one.
