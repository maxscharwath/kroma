//! `GET /api/events` a WebSocket that streams live [`ServerEvent`]s to a client
//! (scan progress, library/metadata updates). Clients hold it open and update
//! their UI in place; the connection survives the lifetime of the app.
//!
//! It also carries the ONE thing clients send upward: a TV attaching itself as a
//! cast receiver. That direction used to be an HTTP heartbeat every ten seconds;
//! on the socket the TV says hello once and then speaks only when something
//! changes, so a pause reaches a phone immediately instead of up to a beat late,
//! and a set that is switched off leaves the picker the moment its socket drops
//! rather than aging out of a TTL.
