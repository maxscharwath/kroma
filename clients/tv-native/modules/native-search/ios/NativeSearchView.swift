/**
 * tvOS's own search screen, with KROMA's results grid living inside it.
 *
 * This is the one screen where the platform keyboard beats ours, and the reason
 * is dictation: the Siri Remote's microphone is never lent to an app, but the
 * system keyboard hears it. Holding the Siri button while a `UISearchController`
 * is up dictates straight into the search field, which is why every tvOS media
 * app (Plex, Netflix, the TV app) uses this exact chrome rather than drawing its
 * own. Adopting it is what buys "hold to speak" without a microphone API.
 *
 * The layout is UIKit's: search field at the top, letter grid down the left, and
 * the search controller's results view controller filling what is left. React
 * renders into that last part, so the grid, the posters and their focus are
 * still ours - only the typing belongs to the system.
