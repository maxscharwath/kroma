// app.json still holds everything static and is the file to edit; this adds the

// compile time, repository), for the line under the story tree.
//
// The kit reports its OWN package version rather than the product's: it ships
// the design system, not the player, and the two move independently. The Vite
// half of this app does the same through a `define`; see vite.config.ts.
