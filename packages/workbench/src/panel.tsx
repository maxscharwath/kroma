// The inspector: what a story says about itself, and what you can change.
//
// It is TABBED, the way Storybook's addons panel is, and that is a correction
// rather than a decoration. Everything used to be stacked into one scroll -
// prose, then usage, then guidelines, then the controls, then a prop table - so
// the controls, which are the only part anyone interacts with, were four sections
// down. Tabs put each answer one press away and let the count on the tab say how
// much is behind it before it is opened.
//
// The panel has two shapes, because the content is the same either way and only
// the room differs. Beside the canvas it is a column. Under the canvas it is a
// dock, and the docked one collapses to its tab row on a phone, where the canvas
// and the panel are otherwise fighting over one short column.
