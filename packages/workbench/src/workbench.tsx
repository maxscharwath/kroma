// The workbench shell.
//
// This is the replacement for Storybook, and the reason it can be this small is
// that it is not a separate application. Storybook ships a manager UI, an iframe
// protocol between it and your components, a builder abstraction and an addon
// API, because it has to host any framework's components inside its own React
// tree. Here the components and the tool are the same design system, rendered by
// the same renderer, in one tree. What is left after removing all of that is a
// tree, a canvas and an inspector.
//
// The consequence worth the trouble: it runs wherever the kit runs. Open it in a
// browser shell, or mount it in the Apple TV app, and you are inspecting the
// components on the device that actually has to display them.
//
// It knows NO APP. The stories are a prop, the mark at the top of the tree is a
// slot, and any lens beyond the ones acting on its own canvas is handed in. That
// is what lets a second design system mount this without forking it, and it is
// why the one thing this file used to import from the app - the i18n provider,
// so translated components could render at all - is now the host's job to wrap
// around it. See the package README for the twelve lines that binding takes.
//
// The LAYOUT it wears is Storybook's, because that arrangement has been argued
// over for ten years and it wins on the same grounds every time: the brand and
// the search sit at the top of the explorer, the toolbar spans only the canvas
// it acts on, and the addons panel is tabbed. There is no full-width chrome, so
// nothing on screen is unattached to the component being looked at.
