// The MOBILE form-factor scale.
//
// The palette, the brand and the motion are shared with the 10-foot design and
// live in the other token files. What genuinely differs is scale: a phone is
// held at arm's length and a TV is watched from three metres, so the type ramp
// is smaller and the corners are rounder. Those are design decisions, not
// drift, which is exactly why they belong HERE rather than in the mobile app:
// one design system, two form factors, both in one place.
//
// Where the 10-foot scale is authored on a fixed 1920x1080 canvas (see CANVAS),
// the mobile scale is authored against a real device's points, so its numbers
// are read as-is with no stage in between.
