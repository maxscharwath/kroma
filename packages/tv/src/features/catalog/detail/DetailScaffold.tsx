 * Shared chrome for the Film / Série detail screens: full-bleed backdrop, veil,
 * the overline + title + meta row + synopsis header, and the persistent top nav.
 *
 * The screen's `actions` are a prop rather than the first of its `children`
 * because the header and its buttons are ONE row: the eye reads them as one
 * block, and so does the page's scroller, which shows a row from its top. Were
 * the buttons a row of their own, taking the focus would align THEM near the top
 * of the screen and push the title and the synopsis off it - and coming back up
 * from the episodes would do exactly the same, so the header would never return.
 * Everything below the header renders as `children`, one row each.
