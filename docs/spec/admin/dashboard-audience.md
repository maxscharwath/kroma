# Dashboard: who is watching, and how much

Status: **AGREED**

Below the resource charts the dashboard stops being about the machine and starts being
about the household. Two panels: who watched most, and how much was watched over time.
Both read the play log, so both are only as good as what the log kept. What it keeps is
[`watch-history.md`](watch-history.md).

## Top viewers

Status: **AGREED**

**ADMIN-26** (AGREED) - The panel ranks accounts by time watched over a chosen window, most
first, and shows each one's play count beside their total.

**ADMIN-27** (AGREED) - Each card breaks its total down by kind of media, one row for movies
and one for shows, and marks the kind that account spent most of its time on. A kind with no
time keeps its row, so an account that watched only shows is visibly an account that watched
no movies.

**ADMIN-28** (AGREED) - An account that watched nothing in the window still appears, with
zeroes. An owner comparing members needs the absences as much as the totals.

**ADMIN-29** (AGREED) - The window control offers the last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 90
days, the last year, and everything the log holds. Seven days is the default.

**ADMIN-30** (AGREED) - With more accounts than fit, the panel pages through them rather
than shrinking the cards or scrolling the page sideways.

**ADMIN-31** (AGREED) - Each card carries the account's avatar where it has one, and falls
back to a name-seeded mark rather than a blank.

## Playback over time

Status: **AGREED**

**ADMIN-32** (AGREED) - The panel plots time watched per bucket over a chosen window,
stacked by kind of media, so the height of a bucket is that period's total and the bands
are its composition.

**ADMIN-33** (AGREED) - The bucket width is chosen from the window so the chart always
holds a readable number of bars: days for a short window, weeks for a long one. Each bucket
is labelled with the dates it covers.

**ADMIN-34** (AGREED) - The panel carries three independent filters: kind of media, account,
and window. Any combination is valid, and changing one never resets another.

**ADMIN-35** (AGREED) - The account filter lists every account with history in the window,
plus an "everyone" entry, which is the default.

**ADMIN-36** (AGREED) - A footer states the total time for each kind of media over the whole
window, so the reader gets the totals the stacked bars only imply.

**ADMIN-37** (AGREED) - The panel links to the full history screen
([`watch-history.md`](watch-history.md)), carrying its current filters across, so a reader
who has narrowed the chart does not narrow it again on arrival.

**ADMIN-38** (AGREED) - Each kind of media keeps one colour across this panel, the top-viewer
cards and the history screen, for the reason given in ADMIN-23.
